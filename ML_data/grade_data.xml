1:  Since the windshield exerts a force on the mosquito, which we can call action, the mosquito exerts an equal and opposite force on the windshield, called the reaction.
2:  The action  is the windshield squashing the mosquito, and the equal and opposite reaction is the mosquito hitting the windshield.
3:  The force exerted by the windshield on the mosquito and the force exerted by the mosquito on the windshield are a third-law pair of action and reaction.
4:  The force exerted by the windshield on the mosquito and the force exerted by the mosquito on the windshield are an action-reaction pair

1:  An object at rest will stay at rest and at object moving with constant velocity in a straight line will continue moving with constant velocity in a straight line as long as the net force acting on the object is zero.
2:  If all the forces acting on an object add up to zero (accounting for the direction of the forces and not just their magnitude) then the acceleration of that object also has to be zero. It can move at a constant speed but it cannot be accelerating.
3:  When the object is in equilibrium or velocity is constant, the sum of all forces will equal 0

1:  An object at rest will stay at rest and at object moving with constant velocity in a straight line will continue moving with constant velocity in a straight line as long as the net force acting on the object is zero.
2:  If all the forces acting on an object add up to zero (accounting for the direction of the forces and not just their magnitude) then the acceleration of that object also has to be zero. It can move at a constant speed but it cannot be accelerating.
3:  When the object is in equilibrium or velocity is constant, the sum of all forces will equal zero.

<ProblemDescription>A rocket pushes a meteor with constant force. Assume that the meteor is initially at rest and is far enough away from the sun and the planets to neglect gravity.</ProblemDescription>
<Question>How will the meteor move?</Question>
<Answer>The meteor will move with the speed and direction that the rocket is pushing it. This is because Newton's second law of motion states that when a force is acting on an object, that object will move with the force being exerted upon it, unless some other force interupts the first one.</Answer>

1:  An object at rest will stay at rest and at object moving with constant velocity in a straight line will continue moving with constant velocity in a straight line as long as the net force acting on the object is zero.
2:  If all the forces acting on an object add up to zero (accounting for the direction of the forces and not just their magnitude) then the acceleration of that object also has to be zero. It can move at a constant speed but it cannot be accelerating.
3:  When the object is in equilibrium or velocity is constant, the sum of all forces will equal 0

<Question>What forces are acting on the box? Which forces balance each other?</Question>
<Answer>The forces acting upon the box in the y direction are normal force and gravity. These two forces balance each other therefore the box does not move up or down. The forces acting upon the box in the x direction are the horizontal push from the person and friction from the carpet. These two forces do not balance each other out since the box is moving. the push force exerted by the person must be more than the frictional force in order for the box to move.</Answer>

<Question>What can you say about the speed of the desk? Explain why.</Question>
<Answer>The speed of the desk will increase. Originally the forces cancel eachother out since the desk moves at a constant velocity. This is explained by Newton's first law of motion. However, when the force is doubled, the forces no longer cancel eachother out, and the speed of the desk will increase.</Answer>

1:  An object at rest will stay at rest and at object moving with constant velocity in a straight line will continue moving with constant velocity in a straight line as long as the net force acting on the object is zero.
2:  If all the forces acting on an object add up to zero (accounting for the direction of the forces and not just their magnitude) then the acceleration of that object also has to be zero. It can move at a constant speed but it cannot be accelerating.
3:  When the object is in equilibrium or velocity is constant, the sum of all forces will equal 0

<ProblemDescription>To rescue a child who has fallen down a well, rescue workers fasten him to a rope, the other end of which is then reeled in by a machine. The rope pulls the child straight upward at steady speed.</ProblemDescription>
<Question>How does the amount of tension in the rope compare to the downward force of gravity acting on the child?</Question>
<Answer>The tension in the rope is equivalent in magnitude of the gravitation force acting upon the boy. The boy is going up at a steady velocity thereforce his acceleration is zero. Net force equals mass times acceleration. In order to make the second law of Newton true, the gravitational force and the tension must cancel each other out to achieve zero force and zero acceleration.</Answer>

<ProblemDescription>To rescue a child who has fallen down a well, rescue workers fasten him to a rope, the other end of which is then reeled in by a machine. The rope pulls the child straight upward at steady speed.</ProblemDescription>
<Question>How does the amount of tension in the rope compare to the downward force of gravity acting on the child?</Question>
<Answer>The tension in the rope is equal in magnitude to the downward force of gravity acting on the child. This is because of Newton's first law. There are only vertical forces acting in this instance, and since there is constant speed, then the acceleration is zero. Due to Newton's second law, when the acceleration is zero, then the Net Force is also zero. This explains why the force of tension and the downward force of gravity acting on the child balance eachother out.</Answer>

<ProblemDescription>A mover pushes a box so that it slides across a carpeted floor in a straight line at a constant speed. The push is horizontal.</ProblemDescription>
<Question>What forces are acting on the box? Which forces balance each other?</Question>
<Answer>One force acting on the object is the horizontal push given by the mover. It is possible that a kinetic frictional force is acting on the object in the opposite direction of the force caused by the push. Since the box is on the ground, its weight, which is mass multiplied by the gravitational force is acting on it. The force of its weight is being balanced by the normal force acting on it.</Answer>

1:  Because there is a net force acting on the meteor, which is the same as the push from the rocket as no other forces are acting on it, the meteor will move with a non-zero acceleration in the direction of the net force.
2:  The push from the rocket makes the meteor move with a non-zero acceleration, according to Newton's second law.
3:  According to Newton's second law, the push from the rocket will make the meteor move with constant acceleration in the direction of the force.
4:  The push from the rocket will make the meteor move with increasing velocity.
5:  According to Newton's second law, a non-zero net force means a non-zero acceleration in the direction of the net force.

<Question>How will the meteor move after the rocket stops pushing?</Question>
<Answer>After the rocket stops pushing the meteor, the meteor will continue to move with the same horizontal velocity that the rocket was pushing it with. This is because the only force that is acting on the meteor is the force coming from the push of the rocket. Newtons first law states that the object will continue unless another force acts on it to stop the object or to change its direction. Since there are no other forces, the meteor will continue to move in the same direction as the rockets force.</Answer>

<ProblemDescription>A basketball player is dribbling a basketball (continuously bouncing the ball off the ground).</ProblemDescription>
<Question>What forces are acting on the ball when it is moving upward and it is midway between the player's hand and the ground? Describe the motion of the ball at that moment.</Question>
<Answer>When the ball is moving upward, a downward force caused by gravity is acting on the ball. There is also a normal force, otherwise known as a ground reaction force, acting upward on the ball. While the ball is midway between the player's hand and the ground, the ball is moving upward. This is happened because the normal force is GREATER than the gravitational force acting on the ball.</Answer>

1:  Since the windshield exerts a force on the mosquito, which we can call action, the mosquito exerts an equal and opposite force on the windshield, called the reaction.
2:  The action  is the windshield squashing the mosquito, and the equal and opposite reaction is the mosquito hitting the windshield.
3:  The force exerted by the windshield on the mosquito and the force exerted by the mosquito on the windshield are a third-law pair of action and reaction.
4:  The force exerted by the windshield on the mosquito and the force exerted by the mosquito on the windshield are an action-reaction pair.
5:  The amounts of the two forces are equal.
6:  The amounts of the action and reaction forces are equal.

<Answer>The floor is carpeted so you know that there is going to be friction involved, and because we are on Earth, then there is a gravitational force. The man is pushing the box so there is a pushing force, and because it is lying on the ground then there is a force that the ground is acting on the box.</Answer>

1:  Since the windshield exerts a force on the mosquito, which we can call action, the mosquito exerts an equal and opposite force on the windshield, called the reaction.
2:  The action  is the windshield squashing the mosquito, and the equal and opposite reaction is the mosquito hitting the windshield.
3:  The force exerted by the windshield on the mosquito and the force exerted by the mosquito on the windshield are a third-law pair of action and reaction.

<ProblemDescription>Two hockey players pass a puck between them on an ice rink. Assume that the ice is very smooth so that there is no friction.</ProblemDescription>
<Question>What forces are acting on the puck while the puck is moving on the ice between the two players? Describe the motion of the puck.</Question>
<Answer>There are no forces acting on the puck while the puck is moving on the ice between the two players. Due to Newton's first law, an object in motion will stay in motion until there is an outside force that acts upon it. Therefore, the puck will continue to move until another player hits the puck. Therefore this will be an outside force. If no one touched the puck, then the puck would continue to move.</Answer>

<ProblemDescription>A mover pushes a box so that it slides across a carpeted floor in a straight line at a constant speed. The push is horizontal.</ProblemDescription>
<Question>What forces are acting on the box? Which forces balance each other?</Question>
<Answer>The horazontal forces acting on the box are the mover pushing the box and friction pushing back against the box in the opposite direction of motion. The vertical forces are gravity keeping the box down on the ground, and the carpeted floor pushing up on the box. This problem exemplifies Newton's second law of motion, which states that all objects in motion must have forces working in opposite directions to one another in both the horazontal and vertical components.</Answer>

1:  Because there is a net force acting on the meteor, which is the same as the push from the rocket as no other forces are acting on it, the meteor will move with a non-zero acceleration in the direction of the net force.
2:  The push from the rocket makes the meteor move with a non-zero acceleration, according to Newton's second law.
3:  According to Newton's second law, the push from the rocket will make the meteor move with constant acceleration in the direction of the force.
4:  The push from the rocket will make the meteor move with increasing velocity.
5:  According to Newton's second law, a non-zero net force means a non-zero acceleration in the direction of the net force.
6:  The push from the rocket will make the meteor move with constant acceleration in the direction of the push.
7:  The push from the rocket will make the meteor move with constant acceleration.
8:  The acceleration of the meteor is constant.

<Answer>The meteor will move with increasing speed due to the force applied. Newton's second law states tha force is equal to mass times acceleration so the meteor must be accelerating to have a force applied. Since a force is applied to an object at rest, the object will increase speed. Force is equal to mass times acceleration.</Answer>

2:  The push from the rocket makes the meteor move with a non-zero acceleration, according to Newton's second law.
3:  According to Newton's second law, the push from the rocket will make the meteor move with constant acceleration in the direction of the force.
4:  The push from the rocket will make the meteor move with increasing velocity.
5:  According to Newton's second law, a non-zero net force means a non-zero acceleration in the direction of the net force.
6:  The push from the rocket will make the meteor move with constant acceleration in the direction of the push.
7:  The push from the rocket will make the meteor move with constant acceleration.
8:  The acceleration of the meteor is constant.
9:  The net or total force on the meteor is the same as the push from the rocket as no other forces are acting on the meteor. According to Newton's second law, the pushing force from the rocket will make the meteor move with constant acceleration in the direction of that force.
10:  The meteor will move with increasing velocity.
11:  The meteor moves with constant acceleration and its velocity will keep increasing in the direction of the force as long as the rocket pushes.
12:  Because the meteor's acceleration is constant while the rocket pushes, the meteor will move with increasing velocity.
13:  The meteor will speed up.
14:  The meteor's speed will increase.
15:  The meteor will move faster and faster.
