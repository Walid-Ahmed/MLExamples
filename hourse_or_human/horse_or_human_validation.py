"""The contents of the .zip are extracted to the base directory `/tmp/horse-or-human`, which in turn each contain `horses` and `humans` subdirectories.

In short: The training set is the data that is used to tell the neural network model that 'this is what a horse looks like', 'this is what a human looks like' etc. 

One thing to pay attention to in this sample: We do not explicitly label the images as horses or humans. If you remember with the handwriting example earlier, we had labelled 'this is a 1', 'this is a 7' etc.  Later you'll see something called an ImageGenerator being used -- and this is coded to read images from subdirectories, and automatically label them from the name of that subdirectory. So, for example, you will have a 'training' directory containing a 'horses' directory and a 'humans' one. ImageGenerator will label the images appropriately for you, reducing a coding step. 

Let's define each of these directories:

Finally we add the densely connected layers.

"""The "output shape" column shows how the size of your feature map evolves in each successive layer. The convolution layers reduce the size of the feature maps by a bit due to padding, and each pooling layer halves the dimensions.

Next, we'll configure the specifications for model training. We will train our model with the `binary_crossentropy` loss, because it's a binary classification problem and our final activation is a sigmoid. (For a refresher on loss metrics, see the [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/descending-into-ml/video-lecture).) We will use the `rmsprop` optimizer with a learning rate of `0.001`. During training, we will want to monitor classification accuracy.

**NOTE**: In this case, using the [RMSprop optimization algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#RMSProp) is preferable to [stochastic gradient descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#SGD) (SGD), because RMSprop automates learning-rate tuning for us. (Other optimizers, such as [Adam](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam) and [Adagrad](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#AdaGrad), also automatically adapt the learning rate during training, and would work equally well here.)

"""### Data Preprocessing

Let's set up data generators that will read pictures in our source folders, convert them to `float32` tensors, and feed them (with their labels) to our network. We'll have one generator for the training images and one for the validation images. Our generators will yield batches of images of size 300x300 and their labels (binary).

As you may already know, data that goes into neural networks should usually be normalized in some way to make it more amenable to processing by the network. (It is uncommon to feed raw pixels into a convnet.) In our case, we will preprocess our images by normalizing the pixel values to be in the `[0, 1]` range (originally all values are in the `[0, 255]` range).

In Keras this can be done via the `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class using the `rescale` parameter. This `ImageDataGenerator` class allows you to instantiate generators of augmented image batches (and their labels) via `.flow(data, labels)` or `.flow_from_directory(directory)`. These generators can then be used with the Keras model methods that accept data generators as inputs: `fit_generator`, `evaluate_generator`, and `predict_generator`.
